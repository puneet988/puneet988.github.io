For a newbie in atmospheric sciences, the amount of information and various concepts related to basic atmospheric science and meteorology can become a bit overwhelming to process and understand. Here, I will share some of the atmospheric science nuggets I came across while trying to interpret my results. I will keep updating the post as and when I come across something worth mentioning in this post ðŸ˜ƒ .

1. What constitutes the clouds.
2. Macrophysical properties of clouds.
3. Microphysical properties of clouds.

## **What constitutes the clouds** {#what-constitutes-clouds}

At a very elementary level, cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere [@dunbar_2015].
